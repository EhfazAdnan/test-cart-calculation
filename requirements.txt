Let’s implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items.

In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on).

Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multipriced: buy N of them, and they’ll cost you Y cents. For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 cents individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you $1.30. In fact this week’s prices are:

  Item   Unit      Promotion
         Price     
  --------------------------
    A     50       3 for 130
    B     30       2 for 45
    C     20       Buy 2, get 1 free
    D     15

Our checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we’ll recognize the two B’s and price them at 45 (for a total price so far of 95). Because the pricing changes frequently, we need to be able to pass in a set of pricing rules each time we start handling a checkout transaction.

To make it simpler, we'll also pass the scanned contents of the customer's cart after everything has been scanned, and immediately get the total. Example: 'AABBCABD' would be 8 products in total, scanned in random order as they arrive on the tray.

The interface to the pricing calculator should look like:

$checkoutPrice = calculatePriceOfCart($cart, $currentPricingRules);

Of course, we need a robust set of test examples to automatically test our routine.

To implement the code, use just plain PHP + PHPUnit for testing.

If you have phpunit installed globally, run the tests:
$ phpunit --bootstrap checkout.php tests
